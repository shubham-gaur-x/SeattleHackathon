## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning models to analyze and predict outcomes based on data collected for the hackathon. The main goal is to leverage data-driven insights to address a real-world challenge. (Provide a brief description of the challenge solved during the hackathon.)

---

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to (add your objective, e.g., predict trends, classify data, etc.). By implementing robust data preprocessing and applying advanced machine learning models, the project aims to achieve high performance and meaningful results.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
  - Flask (for web application, if applicable)
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Joblib (for model serialization)

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Mention the dataset source.
- **Description**: Briefly describe the dataset, including the key features and size.
- **Preprocessing**: Outline the preprocessing steps performed, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, or handling missing values.

---

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations to understand data distributions and trends.
   - Insights into correlations between features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selection and creation of features for better model performance.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc.
   - Comparison of model performance metrics.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

5. **Deployment (if applicable)**:
   - Flask app to demonstrate model predictions interactively.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubham-gaur-x/SeattleHackathon.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `HackPOC.ipynb` or `HackPOCTest.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

4. **Run the Flask App (if applicable)**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to view the app.
